üìä Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides comprehensive analysis of call center performance metrics, agent efficiency, and customer satisfaction trends. The dashboard visualizes key operational data to identify improvement opportunities and track performance indicators.
üìà Key Metrics Summary

Total Calls: 5,000
Answer Rate: 81% (4,054 answered calls)
Unanswered Calls: 946
Average Satisfaction Rating: 3.40/6.81
Average Wait Time: 67.52 seconds
Average Call Duration: 224.92 seconds (3.75 minutes)

üîç Analysis Results
Overall Performance Summary
The call center handled 5,000 total calls with an 81% answer rate (4,054 answered calls), leaving 946 calls unanswered. This represents a solid but improvable performance level.
Customer Satisfaction Analysis
Current satisfaction rating of 3.40/6.81 indicates significant room for improvement. The satisfaction distribution shows:

Most calls (2,398 total) received ratings of 4-5, which is positive
However, 813 calls received lower ratings (1-3), suggesting consistent service quality issues
The relatively low average suggests many neutral or poor experiences aren't being captured in the extremes

Agent Performance Insights
Workload Distribution:

Agents handle between 582-666 total calls, showing reasonably balanced distribution
Jim and Martha handle the highest volumes (666 and 638 calls respectively)

Efficiency Concerns:

Average waiting times vary dramatically from ~66 to 70+ seconds across agents
Joe has the longest customer wait times, while Becky has the shortest
This inconsistency suggests process or skill gaps between agents

Resolution Performance:

Stewart shows the best satisfaction rating for resolved calls (~3.45)
Martha shows concerning patterns with lower resolution satisfaction despite high call volume

Operational Challenges
Call Topics: Streaming issues dominate (20.55% of calls), followed closely by technical support (20.28%), indicating potential product or service quality issues that could be addressed proactively.
Time Management: Average call duration of 224.92 seconds (3.75 minutes) seems reasonable, but the declining trend in total call time by agent suggests either improving efficiency or potentially rushed service.
üéØ Recommendations

Immediate Focus: Address the high unanswered call rate (19%) through staffing or process improvements
Agent Training: Standardize processes to reduce waiting time variations between agents
Proactive Service: Address streaming and technical issues to reduce reactive call volume
Satisfaction Improvement: Investigate why satisfaction ratings cluster in middle ranges rather than achieving higher scores

The data suggests a functional but underperforming call center that could significantly improve customer experience through targeted operational improvements.
